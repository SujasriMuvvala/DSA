ðŸ§¾ Conclusion
Searching algorithms are fundamental to problem-solving and optimization in computer science. Whether dealing with simple datasets or large-scale applications, the right searching approach can significantly improve performance.

Linear Search is intuitive and easy to implement, making it suitable for small or unsorted datasets.

Binary Search is a powerful tool for sorted arrays and is heavily used in technical interviews and real-world systems.

Advanced methods like Ternary Search, Jump Search, and Exponential Search offer specialized advantages in specific scenarios.
